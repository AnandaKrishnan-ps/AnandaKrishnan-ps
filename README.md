## Ananda here!
### I see a WHO AM I coming, even if not, I am going to still put it next,
Am a Senior Backend Engineer who believes great architecture lives at the intersection of logic, patience, and chaos management. Skilled in designing,
developing, and deploying high-performance backend systems using Python, FastAPI, TypeScript, and Azure. Experienced in architecting clean,
reliable APIs, automating complex workflows with CI/CD, and integrating real-time communication features. Proven record of leading backend
teams and delivering robust, production-ready systems with precision and consistency.

### If you dislike formal introductions, here is another ABOUT ME
I make backends that mostly work and occasionally impress me. I like understanding things down to the byte because performance doesn’t come from guessing. While most people use print(), I use the debugger — it’s a lifestyle choice at this point. I’ll happily spend hours optimizing something nobody will notice, just because I’ll know it’s better.

I use FastAPI, Pydantic, and type hints like a safety net — not because I don’t trust my code, but because I don’t trust future me. I’ve automated deployments so well that I forgot how to deploy manually, and I’ve made APIs fast enough to feel a little smug about it.

If you like scaling systems, debugging weirdness, or just making servers behave, we’ll get along.
